# TCP Packet Validator

This project is an implementation of a TCP packet validation tool inspired by [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet0/html/#project-validating-a-tcp-packet). The program takes TCP packet data, validates it using a checksum function, and ensures the integrity of the packetâ€™s contents for networking purposes.

## Features

- **Checksum Validation**: Calculates and validates the checksum of TCP packets, allowing verification of data integrity.
- **Pseudo Header Support**: Concatenates a pseudo header and TCP data to simulate realistic network packet validation.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Compatible with Unix-based systems and adaptable for other environments with minimal changes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+**: This project is implemented in Python, so you'll need Python installed on your system.
- **Network Knowledge**: Basic understanding of networking concepts like TCP headers and checksums is helpful.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tcp-packet-validator.git
   cd tcp-packet-validator
